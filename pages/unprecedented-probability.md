# What's the Probability of a thing that has Never Happened?

## Introduction

There's no one-size-fits-all solution to estimating the probability of a thing that has never happened. It depends on the number of times it could have happened.

## The Blunt Approach

The simplest approach is to dogmatically claim that the probability of an unprecedented event is roughly equal to the frequency with which it has happened over the number of discrete opportunities for it to happen. Which is to say, the probability is zero. [Do not do this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell%27s_rule). Seriously, zero is a bad answer to [any question of probability.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QGkYCwyC7wTDyt3yT/0-and-1-are-not-probabilities)

So, how do we do better?
