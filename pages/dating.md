# Dating

Hi! My name is Tony. I am single and interested in dating. Here's what you should know about me.

## History

I was monogamously committed to one cis-het female partner from November 2008 until August 2021. We were legally married from July 2013 to October 2022. There's a great deal regarding this relationship that I'm uncomfortable disclosing in public (i.e. this document), but would happily discuss with any potential (or current) partners.

I have one child, born in December of 2019.

I am vaccinated against COVID-19 and HPV. I get a flu shot every year.

## Hobbies

I would prefer a partner with whom I share some, but not all, interests. My current interests include:

### Aviation

I am currently pursuing my Private Pilot's License. I intend to continue on for my instrument rating, spin check-off, and possibly multi-engine and commercial ratings. All of this is purely for fun--I have no intentions to abandon my career to fly full-time. It would be great fun to have a partner willing to go up in a small aircraft with me. I recognize how terrifying this might sound, so it's far from a deal-breaker.

I also intend to do a skydive (not from a plane I am flying) later this year. If that goes well I may enroll in an Accelerated FreeFall (AFF) program and get my skydiving license. I notice that many people on dating mention a desire to skydive, but few are willing to discuss it seriously.

### Tabletop Role-Playing Games

Early in the pandemic, I began searching for a fleshed-out corpus of fantasy or science fiction. After failing to get into Discworld, I got hooked into the Forgotten Realms setting of Dungeons and Dragons (principally thanks to the first arc of the Adventure Zone Podcast). Subsequently I started two DnD campaigns: one with my work colleagues and one with my closest friends. I enjoyed these immensely, but have (for the time being) burned out on dungeon mastering.

### Sportscars

I enjoy driving sports cars. I own a Red 1993 Honda Del Sol. I have a personal history with Honda Del Sols which is very dear to me. I hope you will ask me about this.

### Space

I grew up in Titusville, FL. If you don't recognize the name, it is directly across a river from Cape Canaveral. I watched dozens of shuttle and rocket launches growing up, never realizing how unusual and cool that was. Now, as an adult, I'm come to appreciate just how grossly I took that for granted. I will never forego the opportunity to see a rocket launch or visit an Air and Space Museum.

I enjoy building and launching model rockets. I hope to get my L1 certification this year, entitling me to purchase larger and more powerful motors, to in turn launch larger and more powerful rockets.

### Hiking

I've noticed that tons of women mention hiking in dating profiles.

### Former Hobbies

#### Swing Dancing

A friend in college convinced me to join the Swing Dancing club. However, I was usually too shy (and too conscious of my low skill level) to ask people at social dances to dance with me, and subsequently levelled off early in terms of skill.

## Beliefs

### Religion

I am a committed atheist. That is to say, I don't know what's going on in the next level below our universe, but I'm convinced that no religion provides any correct conclusions about it. The substantive content of such beliefs is vastly greater than the evidence they bring to the table. It was a variant of this information-theoretic argument that caused my largely fictitious faith to spontaneously collapse like the house of cards many years ago. In retrospect, this was an interesting experience--the closest thing I've ever had to an ontological crisis. I literally had to lay down when I realized it.

There's no reason I wouldn't, in principle, date someone with religious beliefs. However, I spent many years attempting to convince myself of my faith, and many more attempting to convince others of my faith long after it had been destroyed. I am not proud of this attempted deception, and I have no intention to repeat it. So I will never adopt a religion (even if only for ["cultural" reasons](https://www.christiantoday.com/article/richard.dawkins.first.he.was.a.cultural.anglican.now.hes.a.secular.christian/37673.htm)), and I will not integrate with a religious community.

## Preferences

My custody arrangement is such that I get to spend at least a little bit of time with my son each week, and I value this time extremely highly. This places the constraint on me that I must maintain a domicile within a short driving distance of his mother, currently near Atlanta.

I am open to poly partners or a monogamous partner. I don't presently identify with either term, but would adopt one or the other given the specific circumstances of my relationship(s) at a given time. Stated differently, I would be monogamous for a right partner, or poly for a right partner.

I would happily enter a long-distance open relationship, but strongly prefer **not** to be in a long-distance closed relationship.

I am open to a wide variety of sexual practices, but my experience is comparatively limited. I am not a particularly assertive person and will tend to seek solutions to questions that satisfy others around me, rather than exercise my own preferences. Accordingly, I suspect I'd be a terrible dom.

## Logistics

### Constraints

Because of security restrictions related to my career, I am unable to consume any illegal or arguably illegal (i.e. marijuana) substances. I make no judgement of any potential partner who does.

I routinely donate blood and cherish my ability to do so. Sexual activity with several demographic groups would compromise this (probably permanently), so I'm not seeking relationships with: anyone AMAB, sex workers, persons infected with HIV, or intravenous drug users. I genuinely hate this circumstance and offer my apologies to anyone who would otherwise have been interested in a relationship.
