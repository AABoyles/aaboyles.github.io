# Cryonics and Gender

## Introduction

Cryonics are interwoven with gender in a litany of important ways. These range from the most obvious (i.e. the lack of representation of women within the community, which we hear clearly echoing in the language it employs) to the exceedingly subtle (e.g. the failure to develop the natural alliance between cryonics and transgender communities).

## Gender Disparity in Cryonics Patients

More men pursue cryonics than women. This gender imbalance was confirmed empirically in "Comprehensive survey of United States internet users’ sentiments towards cryopreservation":[CR Gillett, T Brame, EF Kendiorra. PLOSOne. 2021-01-07. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244980](sidenote)

> Regarding demographic effects, men’s responses diverged from women’s. As shown in [Table 1](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244980.t001), men reported significantly more familiarity with the topic, more interest, and more optimism that the procedure will be successful. Women were more in favor of making the practice illegal, although only 4% of women selected that option in total. With regards to death attitudes, men expressed more desire to extend their lives beyond what is possible—34% desire to live indefinitely.

This also appears to be borne out in patterns of cryopreservation itself--through the early 90's, men and women were cryopreserved in nearly equal numbers. But then men begin to comprise a larger share of the population, to the present day where men comprise around 58% of the cryopreservations.[See <a href="?q=pages/cryonic-demography.md#ageandgender">Cryonic Demography</a> for more details](sidenote)

In *The growth and decline of cryonics*[Cogent Social Sciences, 2016. Volume 2 Issue 1](sidenote), David Stodolsky argues that:

> The cryonics industry has adopted a strategy that implicitly targets atheist millionaires and alienates women.

He goes on to expand this point:

> The overwhelming predominance of men in cryonics raises an obvious question: Are women more hostile to cryonics than men? The difference can most likely be attributed to the greater religiosity of women—a cultural factor. For example, in the Badger (Badger, 1998) survey, men were almost four times as likely to be atheists (1.93 vs. .58%). Since this was a “high tech” sample, the bias in a general population is likely to be more extreme. We know from the reanalysis of that data, that religiosity is the best predictor of attitudes toward cryonics. This imbalance is another indication that the current approach to marketing cryonics is inadequate to reach a substantial sector of the population.

### Cryonicsts in Marriage

One particularly fraught institution for Cryonics has proven to be hetersexual marriages. For example, a 2010 New York Time piece entitled [Until Cryonics Do Us Part](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11cryonics-t.html) profiled the role of cryonics in the marriage between Peggy Jackson and Robin Hanson. Hanson is a Economist who's signed up for neuropreservation with Alcor. Jackson is a hospice nurse with no intentions of signing up for cryonics. The piece delves deeply into the rift this creates between them, though they appear to have reached an equilibrium whereby their marriage survives in spite of Hanson's post-mortem plans.

However, marriages in which cryonics is a shared pursuit are not unheard of, and apparently a significant motivator of women to sign up. In "Extreme Life Extension: Investing in Cryonics for the Long, Long Term", Tiffany Romain writes:

> Less than 25 percent of Alcor's members were women, and only a small fraction of these women joined purely out of their own interest; most female Alcor members were the wives, partners, daughters, or mothers of a man who joined first.

It bears asking whether we should celebrate or be concerned about the phenomenon. If cryonics is a sore point that husbands are foisting upon their wives, then concern. If cryonics is a shared pursuit taken seriously by both spouses, but which merely happens to be introduced to the relationship by husbands, then qualified celebration. *Qualified* because it leaves us with the question of how cryonics is reaching those men, and why it is similarly failing to reach women.

### Getting Past "Hostile Wife Syndrome"

One answer to this question lies in the language adopted by the cryonics community. It has not, apparently, made explicit efforts to engage with the public conversations about gender in the decades since it emerged. This is reflected in a history of poorly-chosen turns of phrase. For example, the founders of Alcor also founded a corporation called "Manrise". Bob Nelson, President of the Cryonics Society of California wrote a book about his experiences entitled "We Froze the First Man", in spite of the fact that at least two women were frozen before that! There are thousands of similar instances of non-gender-neutral language polluting the cryonics message boards, newsletters, and magazines. But one of these has gained far more notoriety than the others. In 1968 Robert Ettinger wrote:

> This is not a hobby or conversation piece: it is the principal activity of this phase of our lives; it is the struggle for survival.  Drive a used car if the cost of a new one interferes. **Divorce your wife if she will not cooperate.** Save your money; get another job and save more money.  Sometimes a fool will blunder through, but don’t count on it.  The universe has no malice, but neither has it mercy, and a miss is as good as a mile.[Emphasis added](marginnote)

In a shockingly insensitive 2008 handling of the topic, [Darwin, de Wolf and de Wolf propose a "hostile wife syndrome" in Cryonics](https://www.biostasis.com/pdfs/hostile.pdf). If the community truly seeks to close the gender gap, ending the use of such phrases seems a good place to start.

### Polyamorous Cryonics

## Representation of Women

The cryonics community, while failing to adopt gender-neutral language, is not completely devoid of women's voices. American Feminist Author Nancy Quinn Collins lays out a feminist case for cryonics in her 2017 book [Feminist Essays](https://books.google.com/books?id=WxOJDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT25&dq=feminism%20and%20cryonics&pg=PT20#v=onepage&q=feminism%20and%20cryonics&f=false). She observes that many women made fundamental contributions to the early and on-going cryonics movement, including:

* Grace Talbot, who co-founded American Cryonics Society[Originally Incorporated as the "Bay Area Cryonics Society"](sidenote)
* Linda Chamberlain, who co-founded Alcor
* Mae Junod, who co-founded the Cryonics Institute

Moreover, a large number of prominent cryonics cases are women:

* The first case ever attempted, in 1964, was a middle-aged woman
* Dora Kent, the patient whose cryopreservation prompted cryonics' most significant legal battle to date[See <a href="https://www.alcor.org/library/dora-kent-questions-and-answers/">"Dora Kent: Questions and Answers". Alcor</a>](sidenote)
* Du Hong, the first patient to be cryopreserved in China
* Rose Selkovitch, at 102 being the oldest patient in cryopreservation
* Matheryn Naovaratpong, at 2 being the youngest patient in cryopreservation[See <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/kbzype/the-girl-who-would-live-forever">B Merchant. "The Girl who would live forever". Vice, 2015-04-16</a>](sidenote)

This gives me a great deal of hope that we may be able to set aside whatever gendered barriers exist within the community and recognize the full extent of the potential beneficiaries of cryonics: all humanity.

## Gay, Queer, and Transgender Cryonics

Cryonics is many things, but it is decidedly not a naturalist pursuit. One important concept in transhumanist philosophy is the *naturalistic fallacy*, namely that it is fallacious to use "natural" as a proxy for "good". It's not uncommon to hear "unnatural" leveled as a criticism against cryonics (or a wide variety of other transhumanist pursuits), but it's very rare to hear "natural" employed as a defense of disease, starvation, asphyxiation, or any of the other perfectly natural ways the universe may cause suffering and death.

This discourse will likely sound familiar to anyone who can remember a time before gay marriage was legal in the United States (or anyone continuing to live in particularly conservative pockets thereof). Gay relationships were derided as unnatural perversions of the 

## Building a Gender-Egalitarian Cryonics

There appear to me to be two interlocking problems for women in cryonics:

1. Women are under-represented in cryonics, both as living members and as deceased[or "deanimated"](sidenote) patients.
2. Cryonics is described by men using male pronouns and other masculine language, implying the exclusion of women.

People are broadly suspicious of cryonics, and women see gendered language as another excuse not to engage.

I don't believe either problem can be solved without some strategy for addressing the other.
