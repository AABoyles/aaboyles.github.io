# Anthony A. Boyles

<p class="subtitle">Data Scientist</p>

## Work

I am cofounder and Vice President of Data and Security at [Ephemerai](https://ephemer.ai/). We're something of a boutique for data solutions, especially in the federal sector. If you have a contracting opportunity, please reach out through [my work address, tony@ephemer.ai](mailto:tony@ephemer.ai). [To reach me for any other reason, see <a href="#getintouch">Get in Touch, below.</a>](sidenote).

## Personal

I am married with a child and a dog. These take up an awful lot of time. On the rare occasion I do have spare time, I enjoy [participating in forecasting competitions](https://aaboyles.github.io/Essays/predictions/) and augmenting the capabilities of my smart house.

## Essays

I occasionally write about a number of topics that interest me. Some of the work of which I'm somewhat proud includes:
* [Cryonic Demography](https://aaboyles.github.io/Essays/portfolio/CryonicDemography.html)
* [The Elon Musk Forecast Correction Function](https://aaboyles.github.io/Essays/portfolio/ElonMuskForecastCorrectionFunction.html)
* [The Monte Hall Problem and Optimal Guessing Strategy on the GRE](https://aaboyles.github.io/Essays/essays/MonteHallGREGuessing.html)

## Meta

This site is largely inspired by [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/), though it doesn't share any code with it.[I considered forking it, but I would take awhile to get up to speed in Haskell and <a href="https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net">Gwern's repository is enormous</a>](sidenote) Instead, it's based on an original markdown site generator called [`uncompiled`](https://aaboyles.github.io/uncompiled/).[I created it essentially just to make this site.](sidenote)

I've made many (many) previous attempts at constructing a site like this. If you were truly motivated, you might still be able to find some scattered around the internet. If you should happen across one, please bear in mind that the further back in time you go, the less likely I am to endorse the content that past me felt was vital to publish in this way. If something I've said (or done) is of relevance to you, rather than assume I believe something because I once did (or said something to that effect), *please ask*.

## Elsewhere on the Internet

You can frequently find me on the internet under the username `aaboyles`. Some noteable places where this is true: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AABoyles/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AABoyles), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaboyles/), [Github](https://github.com/AABoyles/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaboyles/), [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/aaboyles), [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/106142/). Some other notable places where it is *not*: [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/246792/tony-boyles)

## Get in Touch

If you'd like to get in touch with me, the most reliable (albeit slow) way is to email me[<a href="mailto:aaoyles@gmail.com">aaboyles@gmail.com</a>](sidenote). If you have security concerns you'd like to share with me, either use a service like [FlowCrypt](https://flowcrypt.com/)[<a href="https://flowcrypt.com/pub/aaboyles@gmail.com">See my public key</a>](sidenote), or email my username at [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) instead. If you'd like to tell me something without revealing your identity also have [an Admonymous account for anonymous feedback](https://www.admonymous.co/aaboyles), though I make no commitment to do anything with such outreach attempts.

I also recieve encrypted chats via [Signal](https://signal.org/en/) [+617-935-5515](tel:6179355515)[Voice calls to this number will be directed to a call screener.](marginnote).

I'm happy to connect with you in whatever other forum you desire, provided I recognize you from somewhere and already possess an identity in that forum (see ["Elsewhere on the Internet"](#elsewhereontheinternet)), but warn you that these will be unlikely to receive any of my attention on any given day (or month, for that matter).
