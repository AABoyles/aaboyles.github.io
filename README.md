# Anthony A. Boyles

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Tony Boyles. I manage technical delivery of data science, data engineering and AI/ML products. In my free time I dabble in [forecasting](#forecasting) and self-quantification (among [other topics](#errata)).

## Work

I am a Senior Manager at Deloitte[None of the content of this site is endorsed by Ephemerai (or any of my former employers, for that matter). This site exclusively represents my personal interests and opinions.](sidenote). Previously, I cofounded Ephemerai, a boutique consultancy for data solutions, especially in the federal sector. [If you want to reach me, see <a href="#getintouch">Get in Touch, below.</a>](sidenote).

I write a lot of code. Some of it might be useful to people other than me. Some of my better-developed projects include:

### MicrobeTrace

The most ambitious project of which I've been a part is [MicrobeTrace](https://microbetrace.cdc.gov/), a CDC-funded open source data visualization platform for molecular epidemiology. Over the two-and-a-half years I was developing it, MicrobeTrace grew into an ecosystem of spin-off open source projects. Some of the more prominent projects include:

* **[MicrobeTrace](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace)** - The app itself.
* **[TidyTree](https://github.com/CDCgov/TidyTree)** - A Javascript library for rendering phylogenetic trees.
* **[patristic](https://github.com/CDCgov/patristic)** - A Javascript toolkit for representing phylogenetic data.
* **[AlignmentViewer](https://github.com/CDCgov/AlignmentViewer)** - A Javascript library for rendering DNA sequence alignments.

### Networks

As a side effect of my tenure on MicrobeTrace, I've developed a fondness for optimizing large force-directed graphs for interactive visualizations in the browser. Some of my projects related to this (*other* than MicrobeTrace):

* **[Network-Demos](]/Network-Demos/)** - A small directory of approaches to improving network performance.[The punchline is to render on a canvas.](marginnote)
* **[Graph-Embed](https://ephemer-ai.github.io/graph-embed/#)** - A technology demonstration leveraging the lessons-learned of Network-Demos to enable embeddable, url-encoded network visualizations.

## Personal

In my spare time, I have produced a few additional software projects, including:

* **[LessWrong-Portable](https://github.com/aaboyles/LessWrong-Portable)** - A flexible nodejs project for scraping multiple web pages into a single epub for reading on e-readers.

...and a good deal of software for this site. [<a href="?q=pages/meta.md">Click here to read the nerdy details about this site.</a>](sidenote) The associated projects include:

* **[aaboyles.github.io](https://aaboyles.github.io/)** - The repo for this site.
* **[`uncompiled`](/uncompiled/)** - The site generator this site uses.
* **[showdown-tufte](https://github.com/AABoyles/showdown-tufte)** - The showdown extension that makes the `uncompiled` workflow possible.

I also enjoy participating in forecasting competitions and augmenting the capabilities of my smart house. I occasionally write about some of these topics that interest me. Some of the work of which I'm somewhat proud includes:

### Forecasting

* [Asking Quality Forecasting Questions](/?q=pages/quality-forecasting-questions.md) - What makes a good forecasting question?
* [Forecast Degradation Functions](/?q=pages/forecast-degradation.md) - Given a timespan within which an event may or may not happen and a time at which to predict it, how should we generate a forecast?
* [The Elon Musk Forecast Correction Function](/?q=pages/musk-forecast-correction.md) - Elon Musk predicts a lot of stuff. He's usually early. We can fix that.
* [Computing Metaculus Priors](/Essays/portfolio/ComputingMetaculusPriors.html) - Does Metaculus exhibit a systematic bias towards resolving questions one way or the other? Can we leverage this to make better predictions?

### Errata

* [Designing the Actually Smart House](/Essays/essays/DesigningTheActuallySmartHouse.html) - The smart house products available today fall short of what's possible. I think out loud about next steps.
* [Cryonic Demography](/?q=pages/cryonic-demography.md) - Who's been frozen? How's that changed over time?

## Get in Touch

If you'd like to get in touch with me, the most reliable (albeit slow) way is to email me[<a href="mailto:aaboyles@gmail.com">aaboyles@gmail.com</a>](sidenote). If you prefer to contact me in a more private and secure way, either email my username at [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) or use a service like [FlowCrypt](https://flowcrypt.com/)[You can use the service without installing it by emailing me through <a href="https://flowcrypt.com/me/aaboyles">this form.</a>](sidenote) to email my gmail address. I also recieve encrypted chats via [Signal](https://signal.org/en/), where my username is `AABoyles.42`.

If you'd like to tell me something without revealing your identity also have [an Admonymous account for anonymous feedback](https://www.admonymous.co/aaboyles), though I make no commitment to do anything with such outreach attempts.

### Elsewhere on the Internet

You can frequently find me on the internet under the username `aaboyles`. Some noteable places where this is true: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AABoyles/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AABoyles), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaboyles/), [Github](https://github.com/AABoyles/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aaboyles/), [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/aaboyles), [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/106142/), [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@aaboyles), [REPL.it](https://replit.com/@aaboyles). Some other notable places where it is *not*: [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/246792/tony-boyles).

I'm happy to connect with you in whatever other forum you desire, provided I recognize you from somewhere and already possess an identity in that forum, but warn you that these will be unlikely to receive any of my attention on any given day (or month, for that matter).
